§Councell forbîds not bookes, but Authors,
damning what ever such a name hath or all
write. None writes so ill, that he gives not some
thing exemplary, to follow, or ﬂie. Now
when I beginne this booke, I have no purpose
to come into any mans debt, how my ﬅocke
will hold out I know ⸗ not; perchance-wae,
perchance incree in e; if I doe borrow any
thing of Antiquitie, bedes that I make ac∣count
that I pay it to poﬅerity, with as much
and as good: You all ﬅill ﬁnde mee to ac∣knowledge
it, and to thanke not him-one∣ly
that hath digg'd out treasure for mee, but
that hath lighted mee a candle to the place. All
which I will bid you remember, (for I will
have no such Readers as I ⸗ can teach) , that the
Pithagorian dorine doth not onely carry one
soule from man to man, nor man to beaﬅ, but
indiﬀerently to plants also: and therefore you
muﬅ not grudge to ﬁnde the same soule in an
Emperoür, in a Po-horse, and in a Mucheron⁊
nce no unreadineße in the soule, but an in∣diotion
in the organs workes th. And
therefore though this soule could not move 
when it was  Melon, yet it may remember,
and now tell mee, at what lascivious banquet it


was serv'd. And though it could not speake,
when it was a ider, yet it can remember,
and now tell me, who used it for poyson to at∣taine
dignitie. How ever the bodies have dull'd
her other faculties, her memory hath ever been
her owne, which makes me so seriouy deli∣ver
you by her relation all her paages from
her ﬁrﬅ making when ee was that
aple which Eve e, to this time
when ee  hee, whose life
you all ﬁnde in the end

Dull ſublunary loverſ love
        (Whoſe ſoule îſ ſenſe) cannot admit
        Abſene, becauſe it doth remove
        Thoſe thingſ which elemented it.
      
      
        But we by a love, ſo much reﬁn'd,
        That our ſelveſ know not what it iſ,
        ꝭnter-aured of the mind,
        re lee, eyeſ, lipſ, handſ to mie.
      
      
        Our two ſouleſ therefore, which are one,
        Though I muﬅ goe, endure not yet
        A breah, but an expanon,
        Like gold to ayery thinnee beate.
      
      
        If they be two, they are two ſo
        Aſ ﬅiﬀe twin compaeſ are two,
        Thy ſoule the ﬁxt foot, makeſ no ow
        To move, but doth, if the'other doe.
      
      
        And though it in the center t,
        Yet when the other far doth rome,
        It leaneſ, and hearkenſ after it,
        And groweſ ere, aſ that comeſ home.
      
      
        ẞuch wilt thou be to mee, who muﬅ
        Like th'other foot, obliuely runne.
        Thy ﬁrmneſ makeſ my circle juﬅ,

        Or ſnorted we in the ſeaven ſleeperſ den?
        T'waſ ſo; But thiſ, all pleaſureſ fancieſ bee.
        If ever any beauty I did ſee,
        Which I der'd, and got, t'waſ but a dreame of thee.
      
      
        And now good morrow to our waking ſouleſ,
        Which watch not one another out of feare;
        For love, all love of other ghtſ controuleſ,
        And makeſ one little roome, an every where.
        Let ſea-diſcovererſ to new worldſ have gone,
        Let Mapſ to other, worldſ on worldſ have owne,
        Let uſ poee one world, each hath one, and iſ one.

        And true laine heart doe in the faceſ reﬅ,
        Where can we ﬁnde two better hemiſpheareſ
        Without arpe North, without declining Weﬅ?
        What ever dyeſ, wa not mixt equally
        f our two loveſ be one, or, thou and I
        Love ſo alike, that none doe lacken, none can die.

        If, aſ I have, you alſo doe

        And forget the Hee and Shee;
      
      
        And if thiſ love, though placed ſo,
        From prophane men you hide,
        Which will no faith on thiſ beﬅow,
        Or, if they doe, deride:
        
          

Then you have done a braver thing
        Then all the Worthieſ did.
        And a braver thence will ſpring.
        Which iſ, to keepe that hid.

        I could eclipſe and cloud them with a winke,

        Alaſ, alaſ, who'ſ injur'd by my łove?
        What merchantſ ipſ have my ghſ drown'd?
        Who ſaieſ my teareſ have overﬂow'd hiſ ground?
        When did my coldſ a forward ſpring remove?
        When did the heatſ which my veineſ ﬁll

        Wee can dye by it, if not live by ove,
        And if unﬁt for tombeſ and hearſe
        Our legendſ bee, it will be ﬁt for verſe;
        And if no peece of Chronicle wee prove,

      The triple Foole.
      
        I äm two fooleſ, I know,
        For loving, and for ſaying ſo
        In whining Poëtry;
        But where'ſ thàt wiſe man, that would not be I,
        If e would not deny?
        Then aſ th'earthſ inward narrow crooked laneſ
        Do purge ſea waterſ fretfull ſalt away,
        I thought, if I could draw my paineſ,
        Through Rimeſ vexation, I ould them allay,
        Griefe brought to numberſ cannot be ſo ﬁerce,
        For, he meſ it, that fetterſ it in verſe.
      
      
        But when I have done ſo,
        Some man, hiſ art and voice to ow,
        Doth Set and ng my paine,
        And, by delighting any, freeſ againe
        
          

Griefe, which verſe did reﬅraine.
        To Love, and Griefe tribute of Verſe belongſ,
        But not of ſuch aſ pleaſeſ when'tiſ read,
        Both are increaſed by ſuch ſongſ:
        For both their triumphſ ſo are publied,
        And I, which waſ two fooleſ, do ſo grow three;
        Who are a little wiſe, the beﬅ fooleſ bee.
      
    
    
      Loverſ inﬁnitenee.
      
        IF yet I have not all thy love,
        Deare, I all never have ĩt all,
        I cannœt breath one other gh, to move;
        Ñor can intreat one other teare to fall.
        And all my treaſure, which ould purchaſe thee,
        Sighſ, teareſ and oatheſ, and letterſ I have ſpent,
        Yet no more can be due to ee,
        Then at the bargaïne made waſ ment,
        If then thy gift of love were partiall,
        That ſome to mee, ſome ould to otherſ fall,
        Deare, I all never have Thee All.
      
      
        Or if then thou gaveﬅ mee all,
        All waſ but All, which thou hadﬅ then,
        But if in thy heart, nce, there be or all,
        Ñew love created bee, by other en,
        Which have their ﬅockſ intire, and can in teareſ,
        In ghſ, in oatheſ, and letterſ outbid mee,
        
          

Thiſ new love may beget new feareſ,
        For, thiſ love waſ not vowed by thee,
        And yet iſ waſ, thy gift being generall,
        The ground, thy heart iſ mine, what ever all
        Grow there, deare, I oul have it all.
      
      
        Yet I would not have all yet,
        Hee that hath all can have no more,
        And ne my love doth every day admit
        New growth, thou ouldﬅ have new rewardſ in ﬅore,
        Thou canﬅ not every ay give me thy heart,
        If thou canﬅ give it, then thou never gaveﬅ it:
        Loveſ riddleſ are, that though thy heart depart,
        It ﬅayeſ at home, and thou with long ſaveﬅ it:
        But wee will have a way more liberall,
        Then hanging heartſ, to joyne them, ſo wee all
        Be oe, and oe anotherſ All.

        SWeeteﬅ love, I d nt goe,
        For wearinee of thee,
        or in hope the world can ow
        A ﬁtter Love for mee,
        But nce that I
        Muﬅ dye at laﬅ, 'tiſ beﬅ,
        To uſe my ſelfe in jeﬅ
        Thuſ by fain'd deathſ to dye;
      
      
        

        Yeﬅernight the Sunne went hence,
        And yet iſ here to day,
        He hath no dere nor ſenſe,
        or halfe ſo ort a way:
        Then feare not mee,
        But beleeve that I all make
        Speedier journeyeſ, nce I take
        More wingſ and ſpurreſ then hee.
      
      
        Ò how feeble iſ manſ power,
        That if good fortune fall,
        Cannot adde another houre,
        Nor a loﬅ houre recall?
        But come bad chance,
        And wee joyne to'it our ﬅrength,
        And wee teach it art and length,
        It ſelfe o'r uſ to'advance.
      
      
        When thou gh'ﬅ, thou gh'ﬅ not winde,
        But gh'ﬅ my ſoule away,
        When thou weep'ﬅ, unkindly kinde,
        My lifeſ blood doth decay.
        It cannot bee
        Thàt thou lov'ﬅ mee, aſ thou ſay'ﬅ,
        If in thine my life thou waﬅe,
        Thou art the beﬅ of mee.
      
      
        Let not thy divining heart
        Forethinke me any ill,
        Deﬅiny may take thy part,
        
          

And may thy feareſ fulﬁll,
        But thinke that wee
        Are but turn'd ade to ſleepe;
        They who one another keepe
        Alive, ne'r parted bee.
      
    
    
      The Legacie.
      
        WHen I dyed laﬅ, and, Deare, I dye
        Aſ often aſ om thee I goe,
        Though it be▪ but an houre agoe,
        And Loverſ houreſ be full eternity,
        I Çañ remember yet, that I
        Something did ſay, and ſomething did beﬅow;
        Though I be dead, which ſent mee, I ould be
        Mine owne executor and Legaćie!
      
      
        I heard mee ſay, Tell her anœn,
        That my ſelfe, that'ſ you, not I,
        Did kill me, and when I felt mee dye,
        I bid mee ſend my heart, when I waſ gone,
        But I alaſ could there ﬁnde none,
        When I had ripp'd me, 'and ſearch'd where heartſ did lye,
        It kill'd mee againe, that I who ﬅill waſ true,
        In life, in my laﬅ Will ould ćozen you.
      
      
        

        Yet I found ſomething like a heart,
        But colourſ it, and cornerſ had,
        It waſ not good, it waſ not bad,
        It waſ intire to none, and few had part.
        Aſ good aſ could be made by art
        It ſeem'd, and therefore for our loeſ ſad,
        I meant to ſend thiſ heart in ﬅead of mine,
        But oh, nø man could høld it, for twaſ thine.
      
    
    
      A Feaver.
      
        OH doe not die, for I all hate
        All women ſo, when thou art gone,
        That thee I all not celebrate,
        When I remember, thou waﬅ one.
      
      
        But yet thou canﬅ not die, I know,
        To leave thiſ world behinde, iſ death,
        But when thou from thiſ world wilt goe,
        The whole world vaporſ with thy breath.
      
      
        Ør if, when thou, the worldſ ſoule, goeﬅ,
        It ﬅay, tiſ but thy carkaße then,
        The faireﬅ woman, but thy ghoﬅ,
        But corrupt wormeſ, the worthyeﬅ men.
      
      
        

        Ò wrangling ſchooleſ, that ſearch what ﬁre
        Shall burne thiſ world, had none the wit
        Ůnto thiſ knowledge to aſpire,
        That thiſ her feaver might be it?
      
      
        And yet e cannot waﬅ by thiſ,
        Nor long beareꝰ thiſ torturing wrong,
        For much corruption needfull iſ
        To fuell ſuch a feaver long.
      
      
        Theſe burning ﬁtſ but meteorſ bee,
        Whoſe matter in thee iſ ſoone ſpent.
        Thy beauty, 'and all partſ, which are thee,
        Are unchangeable ﬁrmament.
      
      
        Yet t'waſ of my minde, ſeing thee,
        Though it in thee cannot perſever.
        For I had rather owner bee
        Øf thee one houre, then all elſe ever.

        Twice or thrice had I loved thee,
        Before I knew thy face or name;
        So in a voice, ſo in a apelee ﬂame,
        
          Angellſ aﬀe ũſ oft, and worip'd bee,
        Still when, to where thou wert, I came
        Some lovely gloriouſ nothing I did ſee,
        But nce, my ſoule, whoſe child love iſ,
        Takeſ limmeſ of ﬂe, and elſe could nothing doe,
        More ſubtile then the parent iſ,
        Love muﬅ not be, but ke a body too,
        And therefore what thou wert, and who
        I bid Love aſke, and now
        That it aume thy body, I allow,
        And ﬁxe it ſelfe in thy lip, eye, and brow.
      
      
        Whilﬅ thuſ to ballaﬅ love, I thought,
        And ſo more ﬅeddily to have gone,
        With wareſ whichꝰ would nke admiration,
        I ſaw, I had loveſ pinnace overfraught,
        Ev'ry thy haire for love to worke upon
        Iſ much too much, ſome ﬁtter muﬅ be ſought;
        For, nor in nothing, nor in thingſ
        Extreme, and ſcattring bright, can love inhere;
        Then aſ an Angell, face, and wingſ
        Õf aire, not pure aſ it, yet pure doth weare,
        So thy love may be my loveſ ſpheare;

        But to marke when, and where the dærke eçlipſeſ beË?
      
    
    
      
        

        GOod wee muﬅ love, and muﬅ hate ill,
        For ill iſ ill, and good good ﬅill,
        But theſe are thingſ indiﬀerent,
        Which wee may neither hate, nor love,
        But one, and thén another Ꝓrove,
        Aſ wee all ﬁnde our fancy bent.
      
      
        If then ât ﬁrﬅ wiſe Nature had,
        Made women either good or bad,
        Then ſome wee might hate, and ſome chuſe,
        But nce ee did them ſo create,
        That we may neither love, nor hate,
        Onely thiſ reﬅ, All, all may uſe.
      
      
        If they were good it would be ſeene,
        Good iſ aſ vible aſ greene,
        And to all eyeſ it ſelfe betrayeſ,
        If they were bad, they could not laﬅ,
        Bad doth it ſelfe, and otherſ waﬅ,
        So, they deſerve nor blame, nor Ꝓraiſe.
      
      
        But they are ourſ aſ fruitſ are ourſ,
        He that but taﬅſ, he that devourſ,
        And he that leaveſ all, doth aſ well,
        Chang‘d loveſ are but chang'd ſortſ of meat,
        And when hee hath the kernell eate,
        Who doth not ﬂing away the ell?
      
    
    
      

      Loveſ growth.
      
        I Scarce beleeve my love to be ſo ure
        Aſ I had thought it waſ,

        Me thinkeſ I lyed all winter, when I ſwore,
        My love waſ inﬁnite, if ſpring make'it more.
      
      
        But if thiſ medicine, love, which cureſ all ſorrow
        With more, not onely bee no quinteence,
        But mixt of all ﬅuﬀeſ, aining ſoule, or ſenſe,
        And ôf the Sunne hiſ working vigour borrow,
        Love‘ſ not ſo pure, and abﬅra, aſ they uſe
        To ſay, which have no Miﬅree but their Muſe,
        But aſ all elſe, being elemented too,
        Love ſometimeſ would contemplate, ſometimeſ do
      
      
        And yet no greater, but more eminent,
        Love by the ſpring iſ growne;
        Aſ, in the ﬁrmament,
        Starreſ by the Sunne are not inlarg'd, but owne,
        Gentle love deedſ, aſ bloomeſ on a bough,
        From loveſ awakened root do bud out now.
        If, aſ in water ﬅir'd more circleſ bee

        Thoſe like ſo many ſpheareſ, but one heaven make,
        For, they are all concentrique unto thee,
        
          

And though each ſpring doe adde to love new heate,
        Aſ princeſ doe in timeſ of aion get

        No winter all abate the ſpringſ encreaſe.

        At Court your felloweſ every day,

        For them which were their owne before;

ANATOMIE
OF THE WORLD.
      
        Wherein,
By occaon of the untimely death of
Miﬅriſ ELIZABETH DRVRY,
the frailty and the decay of thiſ
whole World iſ repreſented.
      The ﬁrﬅ Anniverſary.
      
        To the praiſe of the dead,
and the ANATOMIE.
        VVEll dy'd the World, that we might live to ſëe
        Thiſ world of wit, in hiſ Anatomie:
        No evĳll wantſ hiſ good; ſo wilder heireſ

Yet how can I conſent the world iſ dead
        While thiſ Muſe liveſ? which in hiſ ſpiritſ ﬅead
        Seemeſ to informe a World; and bidſ it bee,
        In ſpight of loe or fraile mortalitie?
        And thou the ſubje of thiſ welborne thought,
        Thrice noble maid, couldﬅ not have found nor ſought
        A ﬁtter time to yeeld to thy ſad Fate,
        Then whileſ thiſ ſpirit liveſ, that can relate
        Thy worth ſo well to our laﬅ Nephewſ eyne,
        That they all wonder both at hiſ and thine:
        Admired match! where ﬅriveſ in mutuall grace
        The cunning pencill, and the comely face:
        A taſke which thy faire goodnee made too much
        For the bold pride of ulgar penſ to touch;
        Ènough iſ uſ to praiſe them that praiſe thee,
        And ſay, that but enough thoſe prayſeſ bee,
        Which hadﬅ thou li'd, had hid their fearfull head
        From th'angry checkingſ of thy modeﬅ red:
        Death barreſ reward and ame, when envy'ſ gone,
        And gaine, 'tiſ ſafe to give the dead their owne.
        Aſ then the wiſe Egyptianſ wont to lay
        More on their Tombeſ, then houſeſ: theſe of clay,
        But thoſe of brae, or marble were: ſo wee

        Yet what wee give to thee, thou gav'ﬅ to uſ,
        And may'ﬅ but thanke thy ſelfe, for being thuſ:
        Yet what thou gav'ﬅ, and wert, O happy maid,
        Thy grace profeﬅ all due, where'tiſ repayd.
        So theſe high ſongſ that to thee ſuited bin
        Serve but to ſound thy Makerſ praiſe and thine,
        
          

Which thy deare ſoule aſ ſweetly ngſ to him
        Amid the uire of Saintſ, and Seraphim,
        Aſ any Angelſ tongue can ng of thee;
        The ſubjeſ diﬀer, though the ſkill agree:
        For aſ by infant yeareſ men judge of age,
        Thy early love, thy vertueſ did preſage,
        What high part thou bear'ﬅ in thoſe beﬅ of ſongſ,
        Whereto no burden, nor no end belongſ.
        Sing on thou virgin Soꝗle, whoſe lofull gaine
        Thy loveck parentſ have ꝗewail'd in vaine;
        Never may thy Name be in our ſongſ forgot,
        Till wee all ng thy ditty and thy note.

Where loath to make the Saintſ attend her long,
        She'ſ now a part both of the uire, and Song.

        But goodnee, to ſee her, whom all would ſee,
        Ꝗll muﬅ endeavour to be good aſ ee.)
        Thiſ great conſumption to a fever turn'd,

        Žo thou cke World, mꝖﬅak'ﬅ thy ſelże to bee

        Her death did wound and tame thee than, and than

        That wound waſ deep, but 'tiſ more miżery,
        That thou haﬅ loﬅ thy ſenſe and memor.

        For aſ a child kept from the Fount, untill

Some monethſ e hath beene dead (but beìng dead,
        Meaſureſ of timeſ are all determined)
        But long e'ath beene away, long, long, et none
        Oﬀerſ to tell uſ who it iſ that'ſ gone.
        But aſ in ﬅateſ doubtfull of future heireſ,
        When cknee without remedie empaireſ
        The preſent Prince, they're loth it ould be ſaid,
        The Prince doth langui, or the Prince iſ dead:
        So mankinde feeling no a generall tha,
        A ﬅrong example gone, equall to law;
        The Cyment which did faithfully compa,
        And glue all vertueſ, now reſolv'd, and ſlack'd,
        Thought it ſome blaſphemy to ſay 'waſ dead,
        Or that our weaknee waſ diſcovered
        In that confeſon; therefore ſpoke no more
        Then tongueſ, the Soule being gone, the loe deplore.
        But though ĳt be too late to ſuccour thee,
        Žicke World, yea, dead, yea putriﬁed, nce ee
        Thy'intrinque balme, and thy preſervative,
        Can never be renew'd, thou never live,
        I (nce no man can make thee live) will tr,
        What wee may gaine by thy Anatomy.
        Her death hath taught uſ dearely, that thou art
        Corrupt and mortall in thy pureﬅ part.
        Let no man ſay, the world it ſelfe being dead,
        'Tiſ labour loﬅ to have diſcovered
        The worldſ inﬁrmitieſ, nce there iſ none
        Alive to ﬅúdy thiſ dieion;
        For there'ſ a kinde of World remaining ﬅill,
        Though ee which did inanimate and ﬁll
        
          

The world, be gone, yet in thiſ laﬅ long night,
        Her Ghoﬅ dꝙth walke, that iſ, a glimmering light,
        A faint weake love of vertue, and of good,
        Reﬂeſ from her, ož them which underﬅood
        Her worth; and though e have ut in all day,
        The twilight of her memory doth ﬅay;
        Which, from the carcae of the old world, free,
        Createſ a new world, and new creatureſ bee
        Produc'd: the matter and the ﬅuﬀe of thiſ,
        Her vertue, and the forme our praice iſ:
        And thought to be thuſ elemented, arme
        Theſe creatureſ, from homeborne intrinque harme,
        (For all aum'd unto thiſ dignitie,
        So many weedlee Paradiſeſ bee,
        Which of themſelveſ produce no vꝙnemouſ nne,

        Yet becauſe oÜtward ﬅormeſ the ﬅrongeﬅ breake,
        And ﬅrength ìt ſelfe by conﬁdence groweſ weake,
        Thiſ new world may be ſafer, being told
        
          The ckneſ of the World The dangerſ and diſeaſeſ of the old:
        For with due temper men doe then forgoe,

          Impoſbili∣ty of health There iſ no health; Phytianſ ſay that wee,
        At beﬅ, enjoy but a neutralitie.
        And can there bee worſe cknee, then to know
        That we are never well, nor can be ſo?
        Wee are borne ruinouſ: poore motherſ cry,
        That children come not right, nor orderly;
        Eẍcept they headlong come and fall upon
        Až ominouſ precipitation.
        
          

How witty'ſ ruine, how importunate
        Upon mankinde? it labour'd to fruﬅrate
        Even Gōdſ purpoſe; and made woman, ſent
        For manſ reliefe, cauſe of hiſ languiment.
        They were to good endſ, and they are ſo ﬅill,
        But acceory, and principall in ill;
        For that ﬁrﬅ marriage waſ our funerall:
        One woman at one blow, then kill'd uſ all,
        Änd ngly, one by one, they kill uſ now.
        We doe delightfully our ſelveſ allow
        To that conſumption; and profuſely blinde,
        Wee kill our ſelveſ to propagate our kinde.
        And yet we do not that; we are not men:
        There iſ not now that mankinde, which waſ then,
        When aſ, the Sunne and man did ſeeme to ﬅrive,
        
          Shortnee of life. (Joynt tenantſ of the world) who ould ſurvive.
        When, Stagge, and Raven, and the long-liv'd tree,
        Compar'd with man, dy'd in minoritie,
        When, if a ſlow pac'd ﬅarre had ﬅolne away
        From the obſerverſ marking, he might ﬅay
        Two or three hundred yeareſ to ſee't againe,
        And then make up hiſ obſervation plaine;
        When, aſ the age waſ long, the ſe waſ great;
        Manſ growth confe'd, and recompenc'd the meat;
        So ſpacíouſ and large, that every Soule
        Did a faire Kingdome, and large Realme controule:
        And when the very ﬅature, thuſ ere,
        Did that ſole a good way towardſ heaven dire.
        Where iſ thiſ mankinde now? who liveſ to age,
        Fit to be made Methſalem hiſ page?
        
          

Ãlaſ, we ſcarce live long enough to tr
        Whether a true made clocke run right,  lie.
        Old Granreſ talke of eﬅerday with ſorrow
        And for our children wee reſere to morrow.
        So ort iſ life, that every peſant ﬅrieſ,
        In a torne hoúſe, or ﬁeld, to have three lieſ.
        And aſ in laﬅing, ſo in length iſ mn,
        
          Smalnee of ﬅature. Contraed to an inch, who waſ a ſpanne;
        For had a man at ﬁrﬅ in forreﬅſ ﬅraỹ'd,
        Or ipwrack'd in the Sea, one would have laid
        A wager, that an Elephant, or Whale,
        That met him, would not haﬅily aaile
        A thing ſo equall to him now alaſ,

        Aſ credible; mankinde decayeſ ſo ſoone,

        Onely death adſ t'our length: nor are wee growne
        In ﬅature to be men, till we are none.
